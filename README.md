# alias-generator

The goal of this utility is to generate and update the `alias.go` files that are used through-out the [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) codebase. 

The output is modelled on the output generated by [Multitool utility](github.com/rigelrozanski/multitool).

## Installation 
1. Clone this repository.
2. Invoke `go build` to create a local binary. Invoke `go install` to install command in path.
 
## Usage

The alias-generator has two modes: create and update.

The `create` command is used to create a new `alias.go` file in one or more packages. It will recurse through sub-packages and create aliases for any type, variable, constant or function that is not explicitly annotated with a `noalias` comment.

The `update` command will recursively search for existing `alias.go` files and update them. 

There are two ways to prevent an entire package from being aliased:
 - Annotate the package with a `// noalias` comment
 - Remove the package from the list of `ALIASGEN` comments in a generated `alias.go` file and update the file

**Examples**

create a new `alias.go` file for the `inflation` module. Will overwrite an existing file.
   
`alias-generator create ./x/inflation`

Update all `alias.go` files in a project. 

`alias-generator update .`



## Future work

 - Stop using the `ALIASGEN` annotation. Update alias files by looking at which import statements they contain.
